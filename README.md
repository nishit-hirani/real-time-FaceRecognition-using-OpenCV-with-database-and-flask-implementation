# real-time-FaceRecognition-using-OpenCV-with-database-and-flask-implementation
This projects is about face recognition which is connected with a backend and is implemented on web using flask

### Dependencies to run the project:
- pip install Flask
- pip install db-sqlite3
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install numpy

### The Haar-Cascade Face Detection Algorithm : 
The Haar-Cascade Face Detection Algorithm is a sliding-window type of algorithm that detects objects based upon its features. 
### Haar Face Features:
The Haar-Cascade model, employs different types of feature recognition that include the likes of

Size and location of certain facial features. To be specific, nose bridge, mouth line and eyes.
- Eye region being darker than upper-cheek region.
- Nose bridge regio being brighter than eye region.
